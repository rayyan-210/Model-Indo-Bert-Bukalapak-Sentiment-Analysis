# Model-IndoBERT-Bukalapak Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Title

**Sentiment Analysis on Bukalapak Reviews using IndoBERT**

## 📖 About This Project

This project focuses on building a **sentiment analysis model** for Indonesian-language product reviews from **Bukalapak**, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Indonesia. The model is developed using **IndoBERT**, a transformer-based language model pretrained on large-scale Indonesian text corpora.

The goal of this project is to classify customer reviews into sentiment categories (such as positive, negative, or neutral) and evaluate the model's performance using standard NLP evaluation metrics. This project is intended for **academic purposes**, especially for students learning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **deep learning-based text classification**.
